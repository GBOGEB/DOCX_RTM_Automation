API REQUEST PARALLEL PROCESSOR

Using the OpenAI API to process lots of text quickly takes some care.
If you trickle in a million API requests one by one, they'll take days to complete.
If you flood a million API requests in parallel, they'll exceed the rate limits and fail with errors.
To maximize throughput, parallel requests need to be throttled to stay under rate limits.

This script parallelizes requests to the OpenAI API while throttling to stay under rate limits.

Features:
- Streams requests from file, to avoid running out of memory for giant jobs
- Makes requests concurrently, to maximize throughput
- Throttles request and token usage, to stay under rate limits
- Retries failed requests up to {max_attempts} times, to avoid missing data
- Logs errors, to diagnose problems with requests

Example command to call script:
```
python examples/api_request_parallel_processor.py \
  --requests_filepath examples/data/example_requests_to_parallel_process.jsonl \
  --save_filepath examples/data/example_requests_to_parallel_process_results.jsonl \
  --request_url https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings \
  --max_requests_per_minute 1500 \
  --max_tokens_per_minute 6250000 \
  --token_encoding_name cl100k_base \
  --max_attempts 5 \
  --logging_level 20
```

Inputs:
- requests_filepath : str
    - path to the file containing the requests to be processed
    - file should be a jsonl file, where each line is a json object with API parameters and an optional metadata field
    - e.g., {"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": "embed me", "metadata": {"row_id": 1}}
    - as with all jsonl files, take care that newlines in the content are properly escaped (json.dumps does this automatically)
    - an example file is provided at examples/data/example_requests_to_parallel_process.jsonl
    - the code to generate the example file is appended to the bottom of this script
- save_filepath : str, optional
    - path to the file where the results will be saved
    - file will be a jsonl file, where each line is an array with the original request plus the API response
    - e.g., [{"model": "text-embedding-3-small", "input": "embed me"}, {...}]
    - if omitted, results will be saved to {requests_filename}_results.jsonl
- request_url : str, optional
    - URL of the API endpoint to call
    - if omitted, will default to "https://api.openai.com/v1/embeddings"
- api_key : str, optional
    - API key to use
    - if omitted, the script will attempt to read it from an environment variable {os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")}
- max_requests_per_minute : float, optional
    - target number of requests to make per minute (will make less if limited by tokens)
    - leave headroom by setting this to 50% or 75% of your limit
    - if requests are limiting you, try batching multiple embeddings or completions into one request
    - if omitted, will default to 1,500
- max_tokens_per_minute : float, optional
    - target number of tokens to use per minute (will use less if limited by requests)
    - leave headroom by setting this to 50% or 75% of your limit
    - if omitted, will default to 125,000
- token_encoding_name : str, optional
    - name of the token encoding used, as defined in the `tiktoken` package
    - if omitted, will default to "cl100k_base" (used by `text-embedding-3-small`)
- max_attempts : int, optional
    - number of times to retry a failed request before giving up
    - if omitted, will default to 5
- logging_level : int, optional
    - level of logging to use; higher numbers will log fewer messages
    - 40 = ERROR; will log only when requests fail after all retries
    - 30 = WARNING; will log when requests his rate limits or other errors
    - 20 = INFO; will log when requests start and the status at finish
    - 10 = DEBUG; will log various things as the loop runs to see when they occur
    - if omitted, will default to 20 (INFO).

The script is structured as follows:
    - Imports
    - Define main()
        - Initialize things
        - In main loop:
            - Get next request if one is not already waiting for capacity
            - Update available token & request capacity
            - If enough capacity available, call API
            - The loop pauses if a rate limit error is hit
            - The loop breaks when no tasks remain
    - Define dataclasses
        - StatusTracker (stores script metadata counters; only one instance is created)
        - APIRequest (stores API inputs, outputs, metadata; one method to call API)
    - Define functions
        - api_endpoint_from_url (extracts API endpoint from request URL)
        - append_to_jsonl (writes to results file)
        - num_tokens_consumed_from_request (bigger function to infer token usage from request)
        - task_id_generator_function (yields 0, 1, 2, ...)
    - Run main()
